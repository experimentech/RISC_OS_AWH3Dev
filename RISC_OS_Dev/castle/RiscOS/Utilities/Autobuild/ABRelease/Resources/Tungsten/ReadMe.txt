RISC OS Open Release Archive
============================

This is the IYONIX (codename Tungsten) development ROM image. It is a
bleeding-edge build which comes from the latest revisions of all the relevant
sources in our source code repository and is completely untested.

You MUST NOT attempt to program this into the flash of your IYONIX - even
softloading it should only be done if you are confident that you know what
you are doing and have a good backup strategy in place!

Some components in this archive are released under the licence (included in

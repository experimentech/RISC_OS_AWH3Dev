RISC OS Open Release Archive
============================

This archive contains the unprocessed resources for the stable release
of the _BUILD_ version of RISC OS.

They are provided to assist translators in preparing internationalised sets of
resources (which are loaded by the !Territory application) for users in
territories where the default United Kingdom resources are inappropriate.

Some components in this archive are released under the licence (included in
this archive as Licence_v1_1.pdf), or see:

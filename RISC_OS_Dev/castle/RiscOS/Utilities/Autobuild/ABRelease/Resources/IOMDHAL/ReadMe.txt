RISC OS Open Release Archive
============================

This is the Risc PC/A7000/A7000+ development ROM image. It is a
bleeding-edge build which comes from the latest revisions of all the relevant
sources in our source code repository and is completely untested.

Softloading it should only be done if you are confident that you know what
you are doing and have a good backup strategy in place!

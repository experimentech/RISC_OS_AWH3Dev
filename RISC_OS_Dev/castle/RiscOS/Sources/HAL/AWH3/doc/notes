Something like image type =sec in U boot env may be what's needed to get it to boot.

TODO: EVERYTHING!

*DMA
*IIC
*SPI?

*Add hdr2h to Makefile
*File cleanup
*Add support for other H3 based boards
*Add support for H3 related SoCs
*Get VRAM allocated as RAM and not IO?
*Allocate "Dead RAM" around VRAM
*Do something with SRAM?
*Crypto?

C modules build with the -zM flags for some reason. Find why. Possibly CModule

cc -zM -zps1 -c -depend !Depend -throwback   -ff -fah -o o.dummy c.dummy

The hdr2h addition to the makefile appears to be working, although it's
not done too well.

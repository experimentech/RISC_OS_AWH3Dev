
SMB: search

This command is used to search directories.

Client Request                     Description
================================== =================================

UCHAR WordCount;                   Count of parameter words = 2
USHORT MaxCount;                   Number of dir. entries to return
USHORT SearchAttributes;
USHORT ByteCount;                  Count of data bytes;  min = 5
UCHAR BufferFormat1;               0x04 -- ASCII
UCHAR FileName[];                  File name, may be null
UCHAR BufferFormat2;               0x05 -- Variable block
USHORT ResumeKeyLength;            Length of resume key, may be 0
UCHAR ResumeKey[];                 Resume key

FileName specifies the file to be sought.  SearchAttributes indicates
the attributes that the file must have, and is described in the "File
Attribute Encoding" section of this document.  If  SearchAttributes is
zero then only normal files are returned.  If the system file, hidden or
directory attributes are specified then the search is inclusive@both the
specified type(s) of files and normal files are returned.  If the volume
label attribute is specified then the search is exclusive, and only the
volume label entry is returned.

MaxCount specifies the number of directory entries to be returned.

Server Response                    Description
================================== =================================

UCHAR WordCount;                   Count of parameter words = 1
USHORT Count;                      Number of entries returned
USHORT ByteCount;                  Count of data bytes;  min = 3
UCHAR BufferFormat;                0x05 -- Variable block
USHORT DataLength;                 Length of data
UCHAR DirectoryInformationData[];  Data

The response will contain one or more directory entries as determined by
the Count field.  No more than MaxCount entries will be returned.  Only
entries that match the sought FileName and SearchAttributes combination
will be returned.

ResumeKey must be null (length = 0) on the initial search request.
Subsequent search requests intended to continue a search must contain
the ResumeKey field extracted from the last directory entry of the
previous response.  ResumeKey is self-contained, for on calls containing
a non-zero ResumeKey neither the SearchAttributes or FileName fields
will be valid in the request.  ResumeKey has the following format:

Resume Key Field                   Description
================================== =================================

UCHAR Reserved;                    bit 7 - consumer use
                                    bits 5,6 - system use (must
                                    preserve)
                                    bits 0-4 - server use (must
                                    preserve)
UCHAR FileName[11];                Name of the returned file
UCHAR ReservedForServer[5];        Client must not modify
UCHAR ReservedForConsumer[4];      Server must not modify

FileName is 8.3 format, with the three character extension left
justified into FileName[9-11].  If the client is prior to the LANMAN1.0
dialect, the returned FileName should be uppercased.

SMB_COM_SEARCH terminates when either the requested maximum number of
entries that match the named file are found, or the end of directory is
reached without the maximum number of matches being found.  A response
containing no entries indicates that no matching entries were found
between the starting point of the search and the end of directory.

There may be multiple matching entries in response to a single request
as SMB_COM_SEARCH supports wildcards in the last component of FileName
of the initial request.

Returned directory entries in the DirectoryInformationData field of the
response each have the following format:

Directory Information Field        Description
================================== =================================

SMB_RESUME_KEY ResumeKey; 00..20   Described above
UCHAR FileAttributes;     21       Attributes of the found file
SMB_TIME LastWriteTime;   22..23   Time file was last written
SMB_DATE LastWriteDate;   24..25   Date file was last written
ULONG FileSize;           26..29   Size of the file
UCHAR FileName[13];       30..42   ASCII, space-filled null
                                    terminated

FileName must conform to 8.3 rules, and is padded after the extension
with 0x20 characters if necessary.  If the client has negotiated a
dialect prior to the LANMAN1.0 dialect, or if bit0 of the Flags2 SMB
header field of the request is clear, the returned FileName should be
uppercased.

As can be seen from the above structure, SMB_COM_SEARCH can not return
long filenames, and can not return UNICODE filenames.  Files which have
a size greater than 2^32 bytes should have the least significant 32 bits
of their size returned in FileSize.

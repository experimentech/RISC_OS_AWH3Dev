Net
Uses the Internet module to transport Econet packets via DCI drivers, unless you have genuine Econet hardware, in which case it calls that instead. Note that 'Net' and the 'Econet' module supplied with the hardware share the same SWI base, so Net looks up the Econet driver's module base and calls its SWI entry point manually - but the OS decodes the SWI and passes it to 'Net' in preference.

NetI
Similar to 'Net', except it uses the Internet module for full IP routing. ie. AddMap takes a IPv4 address and maps the first 3 octets to a single Econet network number. The last octet of the IPv4 address is your station number.
Therefore, NetI should be used if the Internet stack is enabled and is in charge of routing, otherwise you'd need Net (which does its own routing).

NetE
This is almost identical to NetI, except that the interrupt state is left the same (as whatever it happened to be at the time) before calling Econet SWIs. In NetI the interrupt state is better defined by use of ensure_irqs_on/off. Appends 'EDDS' to the module help string.

NetG
Can also act as a gateway. Doesn't currently compile.

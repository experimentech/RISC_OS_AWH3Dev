/* -> h.DrawCvtTyp
 *
 * Type conversion between external and internal worlds.
 *
 * History:
 * Version 0.0: 22 Nov 88, DAHE: created
 * Version 0.1: 23 Nov 88, DAHE: first working version
 *
 * At present the implementations of the two worlds are the same, so we just
 * use typedef to construct equivalences. If either implementation changes in
 * the future, we will need a thin layer of type conversion instead.

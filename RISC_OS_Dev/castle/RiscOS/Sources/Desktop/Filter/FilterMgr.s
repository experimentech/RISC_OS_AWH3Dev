;; Change list
;;            0.01   16-Nov-1990  Started.
;;            0.02   23-May-1991  Added task=0 for all tasks.
;;            0.03   29-May-1991  Fixed bug, find_filter didn't return errors
;;            0.07   16-Apr-1992  Respond to Service_WimpRegisterFilters, fixes RP-1637.
;;                                * Deregistration ensures that only the low 16 bits of the task handle
;;                                  match since only these are saved in the filter block.  Fixes RP-2404
;;                                * Delay registering with wimp until first filter registered.  This
;;                                  avoids unnecessary degradation in WimpPoll performance
;;            0.08   22-Apr-1992  Broadcasts two new service calls, one when installed, one when removed.

RISCOS Ltd notes on FilerAction
=========================

Author: Justin Fletcher
Date:   06 Mar 1999

Summary
-------
FilerAction can be compiled into a simple application using MkApp, which means
it no longer runs from ROM. To re-enable ROM usage, run test.ROMApp.


Options
-------
UseFasterButton  - allows the use of the 'Faster' button.


action_button implementation
----------------------------
Action buttons are set up as a number of handlers, help messages and names
which can be associated with each button. If a null handler and name are
given then the button is not shown and therefore does not affect the display.
Attaching handlers to the skip handler as well as the yes & no handler will
result in overwriting of the same area of the screen.

The help messages and names are looked up in the Messages file.


File/leaf split
---------------
The filename/leafname split occurs at 10 characters in the display and is
handled by set_bottom_info_field in actionwind.c. This splits icons
specifically at the 10 character limit. A simple fix might be to increase this
limit by a character and place an ellipsis after the filename.

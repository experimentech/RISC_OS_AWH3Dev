	Conversion of DualSerial to HAL calling conventions
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

v1 of the HAL contains a list of functions, and a static workspace pointed to
by r9.  HAL functions are called using ATPCS.  This to call a HAL function
you need to do:

	LDR	r9, [pw, #HALWS]
	LDR	r0, [pw, #port]
	; possibly stack r1-r3
	MOV	lr, pc
	LDR	pc, [pw, #my_method]
	; possibly unstack r1-r3

	LDR	r0, [pw, #Softc]
	LDR	r1, [r0, #Methods]
	MOV	lr, pc
	LDR	pc, [r1, #my_method]
	
	LDR	r0, [pw, #port]
	LDR	r1, [pw, #Softc]
	MOV	lr, pc
	LDR	pc, [r1, #my_method]
	
	LDR	r0, [pw, #Softc]
	MOV	lr, pc
	LDR	pc, [r0, #my_method]
	
	LDR	r0, [pw, #port]
	MOV	lr, pc
	LDR	pc, [pw, #my_method]

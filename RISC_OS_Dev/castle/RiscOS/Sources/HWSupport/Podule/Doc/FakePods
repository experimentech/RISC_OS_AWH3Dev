Fake Podule Headers
-------------------
To keep production costs down the podule ROM is sometimes omitted from the final product,where an interface is built-in to the main motherboard (and hence always present).
In such cases the podule manager can be made to provide a fake podule header, and this is used for STB MPEG hardware and also for the EtherI interface on a Customer F Ethernet NC.

There are two ways to include the fake ROM header:
1. Set FakePodule in the components file (passed in via the MakeFile)
   to the podule id of desire
2. Set FakePodule in the components file (passed in via the MakeFile) to
   zero, in which case FakePodule0 is used from the machine header file

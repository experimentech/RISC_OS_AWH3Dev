Policy post Podule Manager 1.58
-------------------------------
Podule manager will ask the Kernel where 'S' space is.
If it gets an error,it assumes the Kernel is too old to understand OS_Memory and will substitute the
hardcoded IOMD_Base address for you.
If zero,or non zero but unknown then you don't get any EASI or MEMC or IOC podules at all.
If non zero and known then it'll magically update all the podule nodes according to what the tables tell it.

The assumption here is that podule manager's table of known devices will be updated on a 'per new IOMD
lookalike' basis.In a system with no IOMD but still some IO space,podule manager can be fooled into thinking
there're podules with some due care.

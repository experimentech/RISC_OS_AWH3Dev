Configuring
-----------
*CONFIGURE DST                } Implicitly disable auto
*CONFIGURE NoDST              } daylight savings too
*CONFIGURE AutoDST
*CONFIGURE TIMEZONE [+/-]h[:m]  as before
*CONFIGURE <Local_TZ_name>      sets both the timezone and the DST at the same time
*STATUS    DST                  reports either Auto/No/DST (not the name of the timezone as before)
*STATUS    NoDST                does nothing as before
*STATUS    AutoDST              does nothing

CMOS byte &10 bit 0 is used to store the auto setting flag.


Service_TerritoryTimeZone
-------------------------
The timezone has changed.
=> R1 = &81080
   R2 = b0 = DST is off | on
        b1 = automatic DST switching is off | on
   R3 = standard time signed offset from UTC (in cs)


SWI Territory_DaylightSaving (&43077)
-------------------------------------
=> R0 = territory number, or -1 for current
   R1 = subreason

   0 - read current DST state (only for active territory)
       <= R0 = b0 = DST is off | on
               b1 = automatic DST switching is off | on
       This subreason is equivalent to the *STATUS command.

   1 - write current DST state (only for active territory)
       => R2 b0 = DST is off | on
             b1 = automatic DST switching is off | on
       When b1 is set, value of b0 is ignored.
       This subreason is equivalent to the *CONFIGURE command.

   2 - supported
       <= R0 = 1 if this territory understands auto DST (error or
               0 if not)
       Note, it may be supported, but there may be no rule 
       for some range of historic or future years, use subreason
       5 to find out which.

   3 - apply rule to ordinals
       => R2 = timezone within territory
          R3 = buffer containing 28 byte UTC time ordinals
       <= R0 = 0 or 1 for DST would be off | on

   4 - apply rule to time
       => R2 = timezone within territory
          R3 = buffer containing UTC 5 byte time
       <= R0 = 0 or 1 for DST would be off | on

   5 - get bounds for given year
       => R2 = timezone within territory
          R3 = year, or -1 for current
          R4 = buffer for UTC 5 byte time when DST starts
          R5 = buffer for UTC 5 byte time when DST ends
       Remember that in the southern hemisphere DST ends 
       earlier in the year than it starts so R5 time < R4 time.


SWI Territory_ConvertTimeFormats (&43078)
-----------------------------------------
=> R0 = territory number, or -1 for current
   R1 = pointer to input block
   R2 = pointer to output block
   R3 = format to convert and flags
        b0-7  = input format
        b8-15 = output format
        b16   = convert as though DST was in use
        b17   = if DST calculation is unavailable (b18), use standard time instead of erroring
        b18   = calculate b16 automatically
        b19-31= reserved, set to 0
   R4 = timezone within territory

   Formats known  0 - local ordinals
                  1 - local 5 byte time
                  2 - UTC ordinals
                  3 - UTC 5 byte time
                  4+  reserved for future use
   Input ordinals need only be the 7 word format, but output will always be 9 word format.
   Ordinals must be word aligned, 5 byte times are byte aligned.
   R0 and R4 and R3 b16-18 are only needed for UTC->local and local->UTC conversions.

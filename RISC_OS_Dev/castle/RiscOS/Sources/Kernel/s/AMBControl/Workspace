;Notes:
;
; (1) AMBAnchorNode is a dummy node with 0 page entries that forms the anchor of a
;     circular node list. This averts the need for any special case for adding or
;     removing nodes.
;
; (2) AMBMappedInRegister is a 'bitmap' of the current page mapping status of the
;     MappedInNode. This supports AMB_LazyMapIn. Bit n corresponds to the n'th page
;     of the MappedInNode; if it is set, then that page is currently mapped in. The
;     bits are packed 'little endian', so bit 0 is the LSB of word 0, bit 31 is
;     the MSB of word 0, bit 32 is the LSB of word 1 and so on.

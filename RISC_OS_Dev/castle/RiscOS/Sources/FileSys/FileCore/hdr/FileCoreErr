; The argument in the label position is (hex) number which a FileCore client
; filing system can return from its low-level DiscOp or MiscOp calls, or in the
; "Process error" word of a background transfer scatter list. Additionally,
; FileCore will generate errors at that offset into the FS's error block, so the
; filing system should avoid generating those errors itself unless they have the
; same semantics.

; The first postfix argument is used in generating the symbol by which the
; error is referenced. The low-level FileCore error number is called <name>Err
; and filing systems typically define ErrorNumber_<fs><name> and and
; ErrorString_<fs><name>. It is usually also used as the MessageTrans token
; to look up the internationalised version of the error string.

; The second postfix argument is ued to set the value of the
; ErrorString_<fs><name> variable. Typically this is only used by the
; MakeErrorBlock macro (the non-internationalised case).

; In the interests of consistency between FileCore-based filing systems, other
; errors are mentioned in comments. This includes the BBC version of ADFS
; (although only the least-significant byte of error numbers were used there).
;
; In general, it's best to avoid using errors < &40, since these numbers can
; also be disc error numbers. On the BBC, filing system errors were supposed to
; be >= &80, and this is still evidenced below.

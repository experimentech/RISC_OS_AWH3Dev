RISC OS Open. Build Directory Preparation Script.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This script will copy certain key components out of various source
directories and into the root of this build. Wherever you run this program
from is assumed to be the root of the build tree.

Warning: if you are running this on a build tree which you have already
prepared (by running this on a previous occasion in this directory) then it
will delete and re-install the following components (assuming @ is this
directory):

- @.Library
- @.Images
- @.Install
- @.Env
- @.BuildSys
- @.Export
- @.Apps.!Builder
- @.Apps.!EraseCVS
- @.Apps.!WinEdit
- @.Apps.!Perl
- @.Apps.!GCC
- @.Apps.!SharedLibs

Note: some of these components may not be required by your build so they will
not be present after this program has finished.

Wandboard
=========

Welcome to RISC OS for the iMx6 (Wandboard).


IMPORTANT
=========

Note that the bootloader built into the ARM processor on the Wandboard looks
for the operating system at a fixed sector address on the SDFS::1 drive.
To keep it fixed at that one place it is stored in hidden sectors that can't
be seen in the Filer, which means to update the ROM you must re-run SDCreate.

The rest of the space is formatted as FAT16 and can be used for any purpose,
for example keeping a backup !Boot application. Beware! Re-running SDCreate
will overwrite the contents of SDFS::1 each time.

This text file can be deleted - it is not required for booting.

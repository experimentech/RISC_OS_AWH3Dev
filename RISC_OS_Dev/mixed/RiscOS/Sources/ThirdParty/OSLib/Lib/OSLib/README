RISC OS Open is distributing an unmodified version of the public OSLib
library, even though the head RISC OS licence holder has traditionally used
a customised version of the library. For compatibility with this customised
version, the files installed in the Export directory retain the directory
structure of the customised version. This conversion is scripted so as to
simplify ongoing maintenance, and is performed during the export-hdrs and
export-libs build phases.

The latest version of OSLib can be obtained from
http://ro-oslib.sourceforge.net.
